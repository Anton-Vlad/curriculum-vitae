**Binance Bot**: Built a NodeJs bot application that used the Binance api to make automated trades. Implemented features like user authentication, setting up configutarions (amounts, max/min), orders & symbol tracking, small heuristic to decide when to buy and when to sell.
**Slack Bot**: Built a NodeJs slack bot that uses the Slack web api and Redis queues to facilitate communication between waydev main app and integrated slack workspaces. Its main purpose was to do async developer surveys. The manager can create the survey from the main app, and set it to trigger programmatically over slack. The bot would then send each individual slack member a chat with the survey questions, and collect the responses to send them back in the main app.
